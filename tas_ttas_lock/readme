This project requires cmake

In order to build the project, simply run ./run.sh

The script will handle the building and running process

The data will be written to the build folder, you can change it by modifying run.sh

As my example, the data are under build_ch7, the filenames are _tas_1.txt etc...

I run each lock 3 times, you can also simply change it by editing the python code and run.sh

python3 result.py will run the python code to plot the data

Running sample are provided under folder build_ch7

experiment_result.png is the final result
